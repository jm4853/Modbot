# Modbot
An in progress Discord Administrative Bot.

This is a work in progress. The purpose of this bot is to implement adminstrative commands 
to support principles of least privilege. Features include creating, removing and editing
text/voice channels, creating, removing, and editing roles, implementing a banned words blacklist, 
and creating custom emojis. In order to use this bot you will have to create a discord bot
application through the Discord developer portal. The bot can be used by entering your Bot
application's token and then running main.py.
